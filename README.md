# Description
LuminAI is an AI-powered semantic search system for Unix systems. It leverages local LLMs and embeddings to perform intelligent document retrieval: find the exact content you need inside your local files — even if you don’t know the filename or exact location.

✨ Features

🔍 Semantic Search: retrieve information based on meaning, not just keywords.

📂 Recursive Indexing: automatically indexes all files in a selected directory.

🔄 Auto-update: detects and updates new or modified files in real time.

🖥️ Dual Interface: use it via a clean GUI or a fast CLI.

⚙️ Configurable: choose document path, embeddings model, and vector database backend.

📑 Document Summaries: generate summaries and extract keywords from indexed files (optional).

💾 Local RAG: run retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) locally with Ollama or other LLMs.
